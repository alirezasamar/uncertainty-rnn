\section{Introduction: }
Introduction to the thesis \cite{b2} to the thesis \cite{okamoto2004improved}. This section attempts to give a brief introduction to quantum computing. Before entering the microscopic world of quantum computing, we revisit the present digital system commonly used by the masses.  The current digital system is based on binary digits, commonly known as bits.  Each bit is represented with a binary value called ``logic 0'' or ``logic 1'' and the number of distinct states is $2^n$, where $n$ is the number of bits.  Physically, these logic values are typically represented by two different voltage levels. In this thesis, such computers are referred to as a \emph{classical computer}.
